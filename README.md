# Theory

- Progressive enhancement is the way
- Buuut it's hard to do in a JS sort of way
- If everyting was in the light, then it wouldn't matter
- But, like, loading a huge stylesheet is just as bad
- So really, we want html-first
- With bare-bones "skeletal" css embeded into the page that makes it look okay
- Then it comes to life with JS
- Make things easy to build to customize
- That's good
